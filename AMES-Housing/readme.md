# Project 3 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenges
This project uses the Ames Housing dataset, which is available as a Kaggle competition. The goals of the project are to predict:
- The price of a house at sale (regression)
- Whether a house sale was abnormal or not (classification)

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.

This project served as a means to practice the following skills/methods:
- Refining models over time
- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process
- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science
