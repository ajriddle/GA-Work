If you're a fan of March Madness, this is the dataset for you! Every year, Kaggle hosts their "March Machine Learning Mania" competition, wherein you build a model to predict the winner of the NCAA men's basketball tournament.

The goal of the project is to predict the probability that each team in the NCAA men's basketball tournament will beat each other team in a head-to-head game. You are then scored on how your predictions hold up over the course of the tournament, with stricter penalties being applied to your incorrect predictions that you were more sure about (higher probability of winning).

The data contain game stats for each team going back many years, with more detailed stats available for more recent years.
